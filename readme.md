[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mmierzwa/js-dev-env.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mmierzwa/js-dev-env)

This is a basic JS projects starter kit designed to automate as much repetitive tasks as possible.

The kit consists of:

* `.editorconfig` - for common configuration for code editors, like VS Code, Atom etc.
* `package.json` - the heart of the project; defines collection of common packages for front-end development, build & deploy automation scripts etc.
